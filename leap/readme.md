Introduction

A leap year (in the Gregorian calendar) occurs:

    In every year that is evenly divisible by 4.
    Unless the year is evenly divisible by 100, in which case it's only a leap year if the year is also evenly divisible by 400.

Some examples:

    1997 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 4.
    1900 was not a leap year as it's not divisible by 400.
    2000 was a leap year!

Your task is to determine whether a given year is a leap year.

You will see a cases_test.go file in this exercise. This holds the test cases used in the leap_test.go. You can mostly ignore this file.

However, if you are interested... we sometimes generate the test data from a cross language repository. In that repo exercises may have a .json file that contains common test data. Some of our local exercises have an intermediary program that takes the problem specification JSON and turns in into Go structs that are fed into the <exercise>_test.go file. The Go specific transformation of that data lives in the cases_test.go file.
