# Kindergarten Garden

Welcome to Kindergarten Garden on Exercism's Go Track.

## Introduction

The kindergarten class is learning about growing plants. The teacher thought it would be a good idea to give the class seeds to plant and grow in the dirt. The children have put little cups along the window sills and planted one type of plant in each cup, choosing from grass, clover, radishes, and violets.

## Instructions

Given a diagram of the plants in a windowsill (from left-to-right starting with the row nearest the window), determine which plants belong to each student.

The teacher assigned cups to the students alphabetically by their names, with each student getting 4 cups (two on each row).

For example, if the garden looks like this:
```
[window][window][window]
VRCGVVRVCGGCCGVRGCVCGCGV
VRCCCGCRRGVCGCRVVCVGCGCV
```

Then if asked for Alice's plants, it would provide:
- Violets, radishes, violets, radishes

While asking for Bob's plants would yield:
- Clover, grass, clover, clover

### Garden Layout

- There are 12 children in the class: Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, Fred, Ginny, Harriet, Ileana, Joseph, Kincaid, and Larry.
- Each child gets 4 cups, two on each row.
