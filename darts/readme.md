Instructions

Write a function that returns the earned points in a single toss of a Darts game.

Darts is a game where players throw darts at a target.

In our particular instance of the game, the target rewards 4 different amounts of points, depending on where the dart lands:

Our dart scoreboard with values from a complete miss to a bullseye

    If the dart lands outside the target, player earns no points (0 points).
    If the dart lands in the outer circle of the target, player earns 1 point.
    If the dart lands in the middle circle of the target, player earns 5 points.
    If the dart lands in the inner circle of the target, player earns 10 points.

The outer circle has a radius of 10 units (this is equivalent to the total radius for the entire target), the middle circle a radius of 5 units, and the inner circle a radius of 1. Of course, they are all centered at the same point â€” that is, the circles are concentric defined by the coordinates (0, 0).

Write a function that given a point in the target (defined by its Cartesian coordinates x and y, where x and y are real), returns the correct amount earned by a dart landing at that point.

Scoring Note

In scoring, consider a dart landing on the border of a circle to be "in the circle" and receive the higher score, like "inward scoring" for a shooting contest. A real dartboard avoids this issue by using lines made of wire; the dart cannot land on a wire, but goes to one side or the other.
